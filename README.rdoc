ActiveRecord has_many :through's AR_instance.collection.create seems to act as collection.create!, raising errors instead of merely building the AR object instance with the appropriate errors.


  #results in an error being raised.
  group.users.create(..with..invalid..user..attributes..)
  

Failing specs are included.


  #Hackish Workaround.
  @user = group.users.create(..with..invalid..user..attributes..) rescue User.build(..with..invalid..user..attributes..)
